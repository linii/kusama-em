				"Compared to Seattle, this city was hell on earth. Spending all my time on my work and studies, I soon burned through what dollars I had. And before I knew it I was living in abject poverty. It was one struggle after another: getting enough food to make it through the day ; scraping together cash for canvas and paints; problems with Immigration about my visa; illness...Many of the studio's windows were broken. My bed was an old door that someone had left out on the street, and I had just one blanket... Unable to sleep, I would get out of bed and paint. There was no other way to endure the cold and hunger. And so I pushed myself on to ever more intense work." - infinity net; yayoi kusama's autobiography

				"I wasn't surprised that New York City was awash in -isms, but more daunting was the fact that struggle for survival was such a powerful component of everything. The city was saturated with the possibility of great good fortune but also harboured a bottomless quagmire of shame and blame. And the heartless commercialism of many art dealers was too terrible to even joke about; it was a cause of real agony for many creative artists."
