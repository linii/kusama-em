	yayoi kusama was born in 1929. she grew up in a period of rapid industrialization for japan under harsh economic policies, as well as a growing nationalism that  was eventually mobilized by the government during world war ii.
	<br> <br>

	the sketch at the left was produced while she was recovering at home from an illness she caught after being conscripted for and working at a textile factory, producing military uniforms for japanese soldiers.

	<br> <br>
	kusama's earliest works can be read as early signs of artistic nonconformity  against the backdrop of increasing war-time censorship, propaganda propagated to school districts, and policing of personal expression.
	<br> <br>
	but more importantly, art also became a way of survival, of regaining agency and holding on to reality at a time when it seemed fictional and fragile by both war propaganda and impoverishment.

	<br> <br>
	in particular, her early work references and subverts the tradition of nihonga, originally intended to promote a singular nationalist identity in asian countries colonized by Japan in the 1930's. using nihonga's emphasis on self-development and subjective autonomy, kusama further developed her painting practice and joined the dissident nihonga movement during her brief time in a kyoto art school.

<br> <br>
	eventually, she made herself visible in japan's art scene, first exhibiting with a gender-neutral signature in regional competitions, before appearing in one of japan's leading art magazines using her full name. she was shown in more six solo exhibitions by the late 50's.

<br> <br>
	however, many art critics dismissed her for her eccentric image and were in general sexist in their interpretations of her work.

<br> <br>
	by the late 50's, kusama was ready and determined to show her work in new york city.

	<br> <br>
	---
	kusama arrived in nyc in 1958 it was in a moment of rapid globalization of the art market, specifically the viability of the new york art market outside the traditional capital of paris.
		<br>  <br>
	she wrote: " in the midst of this metropolis that moves forward with creaking noises, which symbolizes American pragmatism, I keep creating uninteresting paintings. This is a form of my resistance."
		<br>  <br>
	she debuted with her infinity net paintings. they were massive in size, different in scale, medium, and range of color from the smaller watercolor paintings she had done before.
		<br>  <br>
	despite this, she continued to have difficulty marketing her paintings to gallery curators,
	kusama then moved on to experimenting with forms such as installation, sculpture, photography, and even street performance art,
		<br>  <br>
	her work accumulation no. 1  was eventually included in a group exhibition with andy warhol, oldenburg, and others.
		<br>  <br>
	her resistance to the growing commercialism of u.s. pop art which others such as warhol embraced led her to transition out of the mainstream art world.
		<br>  <br>
	from then on, she participated in the psychedelic art movement and continued her nude public performances, frequently documented as scandalous in various newspapers.

	<br> <br>
	---
	 in 1989, more than 15 years after kusama returned to japan, her first retrospective was held. unfortunately, like most art critics at that time, it was focused exclusively on understanding and interpreting her art through the lens of her mental illness and autobiography.

	<br> <br>
	in particular, many critics latched onto her childhood memory of a experiencing a hallucination where dots covered every surface as both a potential explanation for her work and source of artistic mystery and intrigue.

	<br> <br>
	regardless of the truth value of her autobiography, which she began circulating in 1975 and has recently pulled away from, it has been used by many western critics to position kusama as an idiosyncratic outsider Other to the dominant histories of painting and sculpture.

	<br> <br>
	her second retrospective in 1998, which was slightly an improvement to the earlier work, instead re-contextualized her work within under-recognized movements such as psychedelic art and eccentric abstraction.

	but her work is best served through an understanding of the complex historical, sociopolitical, and economic contexts which shaped her life, approach to art, and her reactions to the developments of the mainstream art world


	<br> <br>
	---
	though she worked in a variety of styles and mediums, a few symbols and themes recur in kusama's work.
 <br> <br>
	she is most well known for her repeating polka dot motif, a very visually flexible symbol, as well as eye shapes.
 <br> <br>
	she is also known for tackling the topic of sexuality through her use of phallic objects, such as in accumulation no. 1
 <br> <br>
	other strands of her work which weave through various media are physicality
 <br> <br>
	the experiential nature of her work, and
 <br> <br>
	various forms of protest art.

	---
	my emulation project focuses on her accumulation series, which were completed in the early 60's. specifically later works in the series done as paintings.
 <br> <br>
	i want to emulate and explore qualities of repetition, obsession, and expansive infinity in a interactive digital context. i'm using the javascript library P5, a port of the popular language Processing.
	I plan to complete about 5 - 10 such accumulations.
