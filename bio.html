	--- her early work references the tradition of nihonga, a style of art originally intended to promote a nationalist identity in asian countries colonized by Japan in the 1930's.
	after world war ii,

	the cultural politics of postwar japan shaped Kusama's view of art as both nonconformist and expressive.

	<br> <br>
	---
	when she arrived in the US in 1959, it was in a moment of rapid globalization of the art market.
	however, even as she exhibited with contemporaries such as warhol, oldenburg, judd, and others,

	<br> <br>
	---
	in 1989, more than 15 years after kusama returned to japan, her first retrospective was held. unfortunately, like most art critics at that time, it was focused exclusively on understanding and interpreting her art through the lens of her mental illness and autobiography.

	<br> <br>
	in particular, many critics latched onto her childhood memory of a experiencing a hallucination where dots covered every surface as both a potential explanation for her work and source of artistic mystery and intrigue.

	<br> <br>
	regardless of the truth value of her autobiography, which she began circulating in 1975 and has recently pulled away from, it has been used by many western critics to position kusama as an idiosyncratic outsider Other to the dominant histories of painting and sculpture.

	<br> <br>
	but as we have seen, she instead worked in an amazing variety of mediums, from painting to sculpture to performance, to fashion and poetry; she was aware of and subverted many prevailing artistic norms of her time.	her second retrospective in 1998, which was slightly an improvement to the earlier work, instead re-contextualized her work within under-recognized movements such as psychedelic art and eccentric abstraction.

	<br> <br>
	---
	my emulation project focuses on her accumulation series, which were completed in the early 60's.
